                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                        Hi, I'm Peter and I run a one man business built on honest work and real experience.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                        As a teenager, I mowed lawns to make extra money and found myself enjoying the work more than I expected. It was never a big dream, just something I was good at and didn’t mind doing. But with traditional family expectations, I was encouraged to move on and get a steady construction job instead.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                       Years later, serious health issues at 45 changed everything. I struggled to walk, needed a cane, and went through heart testing that made me fear the worst. Although I recovered, I lost my construction job and had to rethink my future.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                        Needing income, I returned to lawn care. That decision led to the creation of Clean Cut Lawn Service.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                        Now I personally handle every job myself. Having experienced physical limitations firsthand, I show deep empathy for elderly clients and anyone who needs extra care. I treat every yard with respect, attention to detail, and genuine care.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This business is personal to me. It represents resilience, second chances, and doing honest work the right way.
